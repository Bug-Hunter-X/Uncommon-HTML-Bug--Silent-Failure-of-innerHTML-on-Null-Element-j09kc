# Uncommon HTML Bug: Silent Failure of innerHTML on Null Element

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to using `innerHTML` in JavaScript when the target element is null. The code attempts to update the content of a non-existent element, leading to a silent failure. This can be hard to debug because no error is thrown.

## Bug Description
The bug lies in attempting to set the `innerHTML` property of an element that does not exist in the DOM.  The code checks if the element exists, but the element with the ID 'myDiv2' is never defined in the HTML, so the condition is always false.  The result is that the intended change to the DOM does not happen, and there's no visible indication of the error.

## Bug Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the target element actually exists before attempting to manipulate its `innerHTML`.  This can be achieved using better DOM selection or error handling.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
3. Observe that the text "This text should not be visible." does not appear.
4. Open `bugSolution.html` to see the corrected version.
